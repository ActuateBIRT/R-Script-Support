# R-Script-Support
Extension to support R language features in BIRT and iHub

## Overview
This project builds plugins to support R language features in OpenText Analytics Â® Information Hub (iHub) and BIRT-based products such as BIRT Designer Professional (BDPro).
The plugins allow BIRT to connect to and query an R installation by using the [Rserve](https://www.rforge.net/Rserve) client/server communication protocol.
